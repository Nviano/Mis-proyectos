          An ancient Ring thought lost for centuries has been found, and through a strange twist in fate has been given to a small
          Hobbit named Frodo. When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must
          make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it! However he does not go alone. He is joined by
          Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin and Samwise.
          Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship
          of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign!
